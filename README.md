### About the project
A simple system I'm developing to learn Java and OOP fundamentals.

This project consists in a system that allow the user to create an account and start to manage their waifus.

Very useful to some people I know...

My main goal with this project is exclusively to upgrade my programming skills, learning (for real) how Object-oriented programming works, and being able to see this on practice in my own project.
